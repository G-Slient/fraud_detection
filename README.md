# Fraud Detection

# Problem Statement

## Introduction

Solving this assignment will give you an idea about how real business problems are solved using EDA. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques you have learnt in EDA, you will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.


## Business Understanding
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company

If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## Business Objectives
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

## Steps involved in the EDA process

### 1. Data Cleaning
  1. Inspect the null values
  2. Inspect Duplicate records
  3. Handling unnecessary rows/columns
  4. Remove redundant/irrelevant features
  5. Data type conversions
  6. Standardizing values

### 2. Data Understanding 
  1. Checking the Correlation between the columns
  2. Detecting Outliers
  3. Derived features

### 3. Data Analysis
  1. Univariate Analysis    
        a. Analysis of Categorical variables  
        b. Analysis of Continous variables   
  2. Bivariate Analysis

### 4. Important driver Variables

### 5. Final Observations
